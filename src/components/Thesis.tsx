            Founders, builders, and high-stress leaders push until they break. Burnout doesn't announce itself—it accumulates silently through missed sleep, skipped meals, and endless grinding. By the time you realize you're burned out, you've already lost months of productivity and well-being.

            nexgroov monitors your burnout health like a credit score. Through daily check-ins, task completion patterns, and team engagement data, we identify when you're approaching your threshold—before you feel it. When your score drops, we don't wait for you to ask for help. We send in support: advisors who intervene with real-world solutions, not just app notifications.

            We care about results, but we care about the totality of the human being more. By organizing builders into squads with focused daily tasks and proactive health monitoring, we help you finish all your goals without feeling burnt out. This happens in the real world—person by person, intervention by intervention.
